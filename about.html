    <h1>Here is something about me</h1>
    <p>👋 Hello, I'm Zaheen Eqbal, a dentist based in the city of Gwalior, India, with a passion for programming and technology. After completing my graduation with an internship in May last year, I embarked on an unexpected journey into the world of coding.</p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>🦷 During my time working as a dentist, I developed a keen interest in problem-solving and analytical thinking, which led me to explore programming as a new avenue for personal and professional growth. Following an unfortunate accident in September, I took the opportunity to delve into learning Python programming language to broaden my skill set and pursue new career opportunities.</p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>💻 As a self-taught programmer, I am continuously expanding my knowledge and proficiency in Python, with a focus on mastering the fundamentals and exploring various domains within the field of software development. While I still consider myself a beginner, I am committed to honing my coding skills and contributing meaningfully to the tech community.</p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>🚀 My ultimate goal is to leverage my background in dentistry and newfound expertise in programming to transition into a fulfilling career in the technology industry. I am enthusiastic about exploring innovative solutions, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and making a positive impact through technology.</p>
